# Test Plan: Magpie API

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the test plan for the Magpie API automation suite. The goal of this test plan is to verify the functionality, reliability, and performance of the Magpie aggregator API endpoints.

## 2. Scope of Testing

### In Scope

*   `/aggregator/quote`: This endpoint will be tested for various asset swaps.
*   `/aggregator/quote-in`: This endpoint will be tested for various asset swaps.
*   Positive scenarios: Verifying successful API responses with valid inputs.
*   Negative scenarios: Verifying appropriate error messages and status codes for invalid inputs.
*   Edge cases: Testing with boundary values and unusual, but valid, inputs.

### Out of Scope

*   Performance and load testing.
*   UI/UX testing of any front-end application using the API.
*   Authentication and authorization mechanisms (as the API is public).

## 3. Testing Strategy

The testing strategy will be based on black-box testing, where the internal implementation of the API is not known. The focus will be on the inputs and outputs of the API endpoints.

*   **API Automation:** RestAssured will be used to create and execute automated test scripts.
*   **Test Framework:** TestNG will be used to structure and manage the tests.
*   **Data-Driven Testing:** Where applicable, tests will be designed to be data-driven to cover a wide range of asset pairs and amounts.

## 4. Test Environment

*   **API Base URL:** `https://api.magpiefi.xyz`
*   **CI/CD:** (Not in the initial scope, but the framework will be designed to be CI/CD friendly)

## 5. Deliverables

*   **Test Scripts:** Java code for the automated tests.
*   **Test Report:** An HTML report generated by TestNG and Maven Surefire.
*   **Documentation:** `README.md`, `TEST_PLAN.md`, and `TEST_CASES.md`.
